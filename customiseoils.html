      <h1>1. Choose the essential oils</h1>
      <p class="introText">
        The essential oils are generally extracted through distillation, often
        by steam, and used for centuries now. The essential oil in soaps
        benefits your skin by keeping the moisturizing level of the skin intact.
        Unlike the synthetic chemicals used in commercial soaps, the essential
        oils are extracted from plants. Essential oils in homemade soaps are
        nothing but concentrated liquids containing aroma compounds from plants.
